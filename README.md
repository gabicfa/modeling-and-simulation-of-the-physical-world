# Modeling And Simulation Of The Physical Word

This is a repository for the projects for the Modeling and Simulation of the Physical Word class, taught at 1st semester of 
Computer Engineering at Insper (Feb-Jun 2015). This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling and computer simulation of physical
systems. Working with a broad range of examples, students practice the steps involved in modeling and
analyzing a physical system, learn the role of models in explaining and predicting the behavior of the
physical world, and develop skills with the programming and computational tools necessary for
simulation. Students work in a studio environment on increasingly open-ended projects, and learn how
to present their results, with an emphasis on visual and oral communication.
